Once upon a time, there a man named Lee. He lived in rainy Seattle with his 
German Sheppard, Maggie. Lee had a job at a comic store just a few blocks 
from Pike Place Market. Lee's manager loved dogs, so she had no problem with 
Lee bringing Maggie to hang out at the store while he worked. Most days
Maggie would sleep in the corner or wait by the door to happily greet incoming 
custormes, but one dreadful day while Lee returned from the back of the store
MAGGIE HAD DISAPPEARED!

Lee had to find out what had happened to Maggie! He decided that he would
tap into his billion dollar fund and hire an army to find his beloved dog.
Soon after contacting Blackwater, Lee had 300,000 people ready to search 
through the city with him.
